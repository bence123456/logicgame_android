    <string name="parks_rules">You have a few differently coloured areas, called Parks on the board.\n The goal is to plant trees, following the given rules:\n\n
        1. A tree can not touch another tree, not even diagonally.\n
        2. Each Park must have exactly one tree.\n
        3. There must be exactly one tree in each row and column as well.</string>
    <string name="minesweeper_rules">Find the mines on the field.\nNumbers tell you how many mines there are close by, touching that number horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</string>
    <string name="lighten_up_rules">What you see from above is a room and the marked squares are walls.\n
        The goal is to put lightbulbs in the room so that all the blank (non-wall) squares are lit, following these rules:\n\n
        1. Lighbulbs light all free, unblocked squares horizontally and vertically.\n
        2. A lightbulb can not light another lightbulb.\n
        3. Walls block light. Also walls with a number tell you how many lightbulbs are adjacent to i, horizontally and vertically.\n
        4. Walls without a number can have any number of lightbulbs. However, lightbulbs do not need to be adjacent to a wall.\n</string>
    <string name="sumscrapers_rules">Please play \'Skyscrapers\' first, as this is a variaton of that game.\n
        All the rules about \'Skyscrapers\' are valid, but the numbers you see on the borders tell you the SUM of the heights of the Skyscrapers you see.</string>
    <string name="skyscrapers_rules">The central grid represents a city, as seen from above. Each square contains a Skyscraper with different height.\n
        The goal is to guess the height of each Skyscraper.\n Skysrapers height ranges from 1 to the size of the city (number or rows/columns).\n
        Each row and column can not have two Skyscrapers with same height. \n Outside the city, on the borders, the numbers indicate the \'Skyline\'.\n
        The Skyline tells you how many Skyscrapers you can see from there, keeping in mind that a higher Skyscraper hides a lower one.</string>
    <string name="tents_rules">The board represents a camping area with some Trees, under which campers want to set their tent.\n
        This means they want to set their tent horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tree. At the same time they need their privacy too, so a tent can not have another tent touching it, not even diagonally.
        Numbers on the borders tell you how many tents there are in that row or column.\nFinally keep in mind these two rules:\n\n
        1. Each tree has at least one tent touching it, horizontally or vertically.
        2. There is the exact same number of trees and tents in the camping area.\n</string>
    <string name="abc_rules">In a similar way to \'Skyscrapers\', your goal is to put the letters A, B and C in the boards.\n
        Each letter appears only once in every row and column, however, differently than Skyscrapers this time you are told what letter you see first from the border.
        Since most puzzles contain empty spaces, the hint on the border does not always match the tile next to it.\n</string>
    <string name="snake_rules">The two tiles given at the start are the head and tail of the snake (it is irrelevant which is which). \n
        Numbers on the border tell you how many tiles the snake occupies in that row or column. The snake can not touch itself, not even diagonally.</string>
    <string name="sentinels_rules">On the board there are a few Sentinels, marked with a number, which tells you how many tiles that Sentinel can control (see) from there,
        vertically and horizontally. This includes the tile where he is located, and all free tiles north, south, east and west of the Sentinel.\n
        Your task is to place Towers in accordance with these number hints, keeping in mind that a Tower blocks the Sentinel View and that two towers can not touch horizontally or vertically.\n </string>
    <string name="binary_sudoku_rules"> Your task is to fill every tile of the board with either a 1 or a 0.\n There are some numbers already given in each level to help you solve this puzzle.\n
        The restrictions are:\n\n
        1. There must be exactly as many ones as zeros in each row and column.\n
        2. There can not be a sequence of three ones or zeros in any of the rows or columns.\n</string>
